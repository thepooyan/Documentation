# Redux!
we're using two libraries here: 
- react-redux: for provider and access/dispatch Hooks.
- redux toolkit: easire store and reducer creation and handling
*redux itself will be installed as a dependency of redux toolkit. so it is usable for [[Reducer combiner]], no need for reinstalling*

```cli
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```


### General structure:
1. [[Store]]
2. [[Reducers]]
3. [[Reducer combiner]] 
4. [[Actions]] 

### Usage (with react-redux):
1. [[react-redux Provider]] 
2. [[select-dispatch Hooks]] 

### getting the INITIAL STATE ([[Reducers]]) from api
1. [[Redux-thunk]]
